Java Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of Java projects demonstrating fundamental concepts such as arrays, lists, encapsulation, object-oriented programming (OOP), and a Tic Tac Toe game as the main project.

Projects Overview
Basic Java Concepts:

Arrays, Lists, Encapsulation.
Implementation of basic operations using Java.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Demonstrates OOP principles like classes, objects, and encapsulation.
Tic Tac Toe Game:

A fully functional console-based Tic Tac Toe game.
Allows two players to compete by inputting their moves, with real-time feedback on the game state.
Detects when a player wins by forming a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Input validation for moves.
Real-time board updates after each move.
Detection of winning combinations (row, column, diagonal).
Full board checks for a draw.

Technologies
Java: All projects are implemented using Java.
Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Tic Tac Toe game.
Implement AI to allow a single-player mode.
